1D_TEST: includes inputs to run dynamics on the 1D Hamiltonian for NaI for 1000 Wigner sampled initial conditions

2D_TEST: includes inputs to run dynamics on a 2D LVC around a conical intersection for 1000 Wigner sampled initial conditions. Calls QuantumModelLib for the 2D Hamiltonian.

In each folder:
Inputs to run dynamics with different methods
input.in --- the input for G-CTMQC
run.sh --- submission script on the cluster

CTMQC: Coupled trajectory mixed quantum classcial (CT-MQC) dynamics
EHREN: Ehrenfest dynamics
TSHFS-CT: Coupled trajectory Tully surface hopping (CT-TSH) dynamics using fewest-switching hopping algorithm
TSHFS: Fewest switching trajectory surface hopping dynamics without decoherence correction
TSHFS-ED: Fewest switching trajectory surface hopping dynamics with the energy based decohrence correction

ANALYSIS: Contains a number of analysis scripts to plot the outcome of each dynamics (see README in teh directory)
EXACT_REF: Numerically exact quantum dynamics calculation on each model as a reference of the approximate trajectory based dynamics
